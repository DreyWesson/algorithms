// A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of
// consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary
// representation of N. For example, number 9 has binary representation 1001 and
// contains a binary gap of length 2. The number 529 has binary
// representation 1000010001 and contains two binary gaps:
// one of length 4 and one of length 3. The number 20 has binary representation
//  10100 and contains one binary gap of length 1. The number 15 has binary
//  representation 1111 and has no binary gaps. The number 32 has binary
// representation 100000 and has no binary gaps.
// Write a function:
// class Solution { public int solution(int N); }
// that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest
// binary gap. The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.
// For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has
// binary representation 10000010001 and so its longest binary gap is of length
//  5. Given N = 32 the function should return 0, because N has binary
// representation '100000' and thus no binary gaps.
// Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
// N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].
